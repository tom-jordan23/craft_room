# RF Research Capability

## Intended Activities
- SDR experimentation, antenna prototyping, signal analysis.
- Low-power transmission experiments within regulatory limits.
- Integration with outdoor antennas where permitted.

## Spatial and Design Implications
- Dedicated RF bench isolated from high-noise tools.
- Cable management for coax, control, and power lines.
- Grounding plane and single-point ground reference.

## Validation
- Ability to run RF experiments without significant interference from shop equipment.
