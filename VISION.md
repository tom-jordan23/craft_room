# Craft Room Vision

## Purpose
A shared applied fabrication lab where two makers can work simultaneously on distinct disciplines without interference, with infrastructure that supports everything from delicate fiber arts to composite boat building.

## The Space
- **Footprint:** ~30' x 20' (600 sq ft)
- **Ceiling:** 9'+ clear
- **Access:** Interior opening along south edge
- **Ventilation:** Back (north) wall has exterior access

## Who Uses It

### Her Domains
- Fiber arts: sewing, quilting, knitting, embroidery
- Fine arts: painting, drawing, mixed media
- Paper crafts: scrapbooking, card making
- Upholstery
- Miniatures
- Plant/garden crafts

### His Domains
- RF/electronics: SDR, antennas, test equipment
- Woodworking: cabinetry, furniture, turning
- Composites: fiberglass, epoxy, kayak building
- Metalwork: welding, machining, fabrication

### Shared
- Center assembly table
- Material storage and staging
- Finishing area

## Design Principles

### 1. Simultaneous Use
Two people working at once is the default, not the exception. Each person needs:
- Dedicated bench space
- Clear sightlines to shared resources
- Independent access to storage
- Ability to make noise/dust without disrupting the other

### 2. Traffic Flow First
Movement through the space drives everything:
- **Primary aisle** runs full width near the open edge
- **Secondary paths** lead from aisle to each workstation
- **No dead ends** - you can always exit without backtracking
- **Material flow** from entry → staging → workstation → exit

### 3. Clean-to-Dirty Gradient
Contamination control through spatial organization:
- **West side (left):** Clean work - electronics, fiber arts, paper, RF
- **East side (right):** Dirty work - sawdust, metal chips, composites
- **Back wall:** Fume-generating work with direct exhaust access
- **Airflow** naturally moves contaminants away from clean zones

### 4. Infrastructure Before Furniture
The bones of the space matter more than the benches:
- Overprovisioned electrical with clear circuit separation
- Layered lighting: ambient, task, inspection
- Ventilation backbone with flexible connections
- Grounding strategy for RF and static-sensitive work

### 5. Phased Build
Get working quickly, refine over time:
- **Phase 1:** Infrastructure (electrical, lighting, vent backbone)
- **Phase 2:** Fixed elements (cabinetry, permanent benches)
- **Phase 3:** Flexible elements (mobile carts, adjustable storage)
- Each phase delivers usable capability

## What Success Looks Like
- Both people can start a project without negotiating for space
- A kayak-length piece can move from material storage to workbench to finish area
- RF experiments run without interference from shop equipment
- Composite layup happens without contaminating fiber arts supplies
- Neither person has to walk through the other's mess to reach their bench
