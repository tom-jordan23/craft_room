# Traffic Flow Design

## Core Principle
**Two people, simultaneous work, no interference.**

Every flow decision serves this: you should be able to reach your bench, get materials, use shared resources, and exit without walking through your partner's active work area.

## Circulation Hierarchy

### Primary Aisle
**Location:** Along open (south) edge, full width
**Width:** 36" minimum clear
**Purpose:** Main spine of movement, material transport, entry/exit

This is the highway. It connects:
- Entry point (center of open edge)
- Material staging (southwest corner)
- Access to both side corridors
- Emergency egress

**Design rule:** Nothing permanent crosses this aisle. No stored materials, no parked carts, no tool overhang.

### Secondary Corridors
**Location:** Vertical paths at x=126" and x=258"
**Width:** 30" minimum clear
**Purpose:** Zone access without crossing center

These corridors let each person reach their zone from the primary aisle without walking through the assembly table area or the other's territory.

**West corridor (x=126"):** Access to Her Zone and RF/Electronics
**East corridor (x=258"):** Access to Fabrication and Fume zones

### Tertiary Access
**Width:** 24" minimum
**Purpose:** Within-zone movement, access to storage

Inside each zone, maintain 24" paths to reach:
- Wall-mounted storage
- Under-bench storage
- Back of benches

## Person Flow Patterns

### Her Typical Path
```
Entry → Primary aisle → West corridor → Her Zone bench
                     ↓
              Assembly table (for large projects)
                     ↓
              Return via west corridor → Exit
```

### His Typical Path (Electronics)
```
Entry → Primary aisle → West corridor → RF bench
                     ↓
              (Short walk to) Her Zone for collaboration
                     ↓
              Return via west corridor → Exit
```

### His Typical Path (Fabrication)
```
Entry → Primary aisle → East corridor → Fab bench
                     ↓
              Assembly table (large assemblies)
                     ↓
              Fume zone (finishing)
                     ↓
              Return via east corridor → Exit
```

### Cross-Zone Collaboration
When both need the assembly table:
- Approach from opposite corridors
- Table accessible from all four sides
- 36" clearance around table allows passing

## Material Flow

### Inbound Materials
```
Exterior → Entry → Primary aisle → Material staging (SW corner)
```

Long stock (kayak blanks, 8' lumber) enters through center, stages in corner where it's out of circulation but accessible.

### Work-in-Progress
```
Staging → Assembly table → Zone bench → Assembly table → Next operation
```

The assembly table is the transfer point. Large pieces go there for layout, cutting, glue-up, then move to zone benches for detailed work.

### Outbound / Finishing
```
Fab zone → Fume zone → Staged for cure → Out
```

Finished or in-cure pieces collect near the fume zone (northeast), away from active work and near the exhaust.

## Airflow Integration

Airflow follows contamination gradient:

```
CLEAN (West)                              DIRTY (East)
    ↓                                          ↓
Her Zone → Assembly → Fabrication → Fume Zone → EXHAUST
    ↓                                          ↓
RF Zone →     →      →      →      →      → EXHAUST
```

**Design implications:**
- Make-up air enters from open edge (south) or west wall
- Exhaust on back wall (north), concentrated at fume zone
- Slight negative pressure in fume zone pulls air away from clean areas
- Dust collection in fab zone uses same airflow direction

---

## Ergonomic Considerations

### Standing vs. Sitting
- **Her Zone:** Mix of standing (cutting table) and sitting (sewing machine) - counter heights vary
- **RF Zone:** Primarily seated - desk height (30")
- **Fab Zone:** Standing - bench height (34-36")
- **Assembly Table:** Standing - 34-36"

### Reach and Access
- Frequently used tools within arm's reach of primary work position
- Shared tools (tape measure, pencils, utility knife) at assembly table
- Fire extinguisher visible from all zones, near exit

### Noise Isolation
- Her Zone and RF Zone share the quiet side
- When fabrication tools run, sound travels away from clean zones
- Consider acoustic panel on west side of east corridor

---

## Emergency Egress

From any point in the room, two paths to exit:

| Position | Path A | Path B |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Her Zone (back) | West corridor → South | Through assembly area → South |
| RF Zone | West corridor → South | Through Her Zone → South |
| Fab Zone | East corridor → South | Through assembly area → South |
| Fume Zone | East corridor → South | Along back wall → West corridor |

**Rule:** No zone has only one exit path. Even at maximum bench depth, you can get out two ways.

## Flow Validation Checklist

Before finalizing layout, walk through these scenarios:

- [ ] Can she reach her bench with a bolt of fabric without passing his active saw?
- [ ] Can he carry an 8' board from staging to fab bench without bumping her sewing area?
- [ ] Can both approach assembly table simultaneously from opposite sides?
- [ ] Can fume zone be accessed without walking through fabric storage?
- [ ] Is fire extinguisher reachable within 15 seconds from any point?
- [ ] Can a 16' kayak blank be maneuvered from entry to assembly table?
