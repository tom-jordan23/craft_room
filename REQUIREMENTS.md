# Requirements

## Functional Requirements
- Support clean analytical work, precision fabrication, dirty operations, chemical/composite work, and RF experimentation concurrently.
- Allow rapid reconfiguration without structural modification.
- Maintain long clear runs for large assemblies and kayak-length materials.

## Safety and Environmental
- Localized ventilation for fumes and composites.
- Dust management for woodworking operations.
- Fire-safe storage for chemicals and finishes.

## Infrastructure
- Overprovisioned electrical capacity with clear circuit separation.
- Layered lighting for fabrication, inspection, and documentation.
- Explicit grounding and bonding strategy for electronics and RF work.

## RF Research and Experimentation
- Space for bench-top RF experiments (HF–UHF), SDRs, antennas, and test gear.
- RF-quiet zone considerations for sensitive measurements.
- Provision for coax routing, grounding bars, and transient protection.
