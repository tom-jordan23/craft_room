## Alternative Options Considered

### Mid-Tier Alternatives

| Collector | CFM | Price | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|-------|
| [Grizzly G0548ZP 2HP](https://www.grizzly.com/products/grizzly-2-hp-canister-dust-collector-with-aluminum-impeller-polar-bear-series/g0548zp) | 1,700 | $949 | High CFM, 1-micron, 240V required |
| [Clear Vue CV1700 5HP](https://www.clearvuecyclones.com/product/cv1700-single-phase/) | High | $3,471 | Bill Pentz design, excellent cyclone |
| [JET DC-1100VX](https://www.jettools.com/) | 1,100 | ~$800 | Good budget option, needs filter upgrade |

### Why Not These?

- **Grizzly G0548ZP**: Great value but 240V required and only 1-micron (not HEPA)
- **Clear Vue**: Excellent design but similar price to Laguna with less turnkey convenience
- **JET DC-1100VX**: Good CFM but bag filter needs Wynn upgrade, no cyclone

## Recommended Build: Best Value

For your craft room with mixed woodworking, metalwork, and composites, the **Best Value build (Laguna P|Flux 1 + iVAC)** is the sweet spot:

1. **HEPA is non-negotiable** for composite dust (fiberglass, carbon fiber, epoxy)
2. **Automation** means consistent dust capture (no forgotten blast gates)
3. **120V** means no electrical work for Phase 1
4. **Mobile** lets you finalize layout before permanent ducting
5. **~$5,400** is significant but not overkill for a serious shop

Start with the collector + a few automated gates on primary tools. Add ducting and more gates as the shop matures.
